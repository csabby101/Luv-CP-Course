# Luv's CP Course
This repository contains (will contain) :
* Solutions to problems from the [Competitive Programming Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-) offered by [Luv](https://github.com/luvk1412) on YouTube. <br>The problem links are usually present in the video's description, but I've made sure to add them at the very top in each solution file.)
* Notes from certain episodes. (generally syntax that I didn't knew before) <br>Note : To be pushed.
* Solutions to contest problems.

## Why there needs to be repo for solutions?
The need to create this repo arises from my personal experiences while taking thus course. As a beginner, I encountered many difficulties while solving some of the problems. Sometimes the concept or the optimized approach required to get an *AC* for a problem was not discussed in the episode, which isn't a point of critism honestly.
I do believe that **'The Art of Googling As A Programmer'** must be encouraged, but in case of some (rare) problems, there just wasn't any way I could find a way to reduce the time complexity and get that AC.
Competitive Programming or problems related to DSA in general, involve a **lot** of concepts and beginners might get intimidated when they come across a problem that otherwise seems like a cake-walk, but doesn't fulfil the requirements set by the OJ.

## How to use this repo
Fisrtly, do not give up easily. Not every problem requires a special concept. The code can be optimized by basic techniques and leveraging existing resources (loops/memory) efficiently too.
Try your best and if you believe there ain't no way you can get an AC, just skim through the solution (or parts of it) and then try to write it on your own.

## NOTE
I'm assuming that you know *readability* is usually not considered as a point of concern in competitive programming. 
Apart from that, I'm still learning and the solutions (or approach) to some problems might not be perfect. I just applied what I learned from the course itself.
